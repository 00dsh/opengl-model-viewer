# OpenGL Model Viewer
A simple 3D model loader, written in C and powered by OpenGL and assimp.

This project was made firstly to challenge myself on creating an application that used
external assets from scratch, and secondly testing my skills on the C language, more-so 
on the memory management side of things as well as pointer arithmetic.

This application was intended to be a sort of 'halo project', where I sort out the
functionality for loading models, then implement them elsewhere in other games/projects of mine.

**Features:**
- Skybox
- Camera system
- Loading models without crashing (most of the time)

***Logiiq.***
